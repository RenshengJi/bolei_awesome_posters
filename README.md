# Not so awesome academic posters

Here I share some acaemic posters I used. They are not so awesome but work to the degree I survived the conference poster session. You can start with them to build your own awesome posters.

* Poster for CVPR'18 paper. This poster is mainly designed by David Bau. I think the font size is bit small and the content is bit too dense.

FYI: The posters above were presented at some conferences in person. So they used to be printed out with height as 1 meter. If you will present poster online like Gatherly, you might have to significantly increase the font size and reduce the density of the content!
